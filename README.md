# PalChat Website

This repository contains a simple static website sharing perspectives on technology, privacy and finance. The pages are written in plain HTML with a small amount of CSS for styling.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. No build step is required.

## SEO Notes
The project now includes `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to help search engines index the site correctly. Update the URLs in those files if you deploy the site under a different domain.
