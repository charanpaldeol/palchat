              <p>
                Big tech companies track and exploit your personal data to boost their profits—not your well-being.
                That's not an exaggeration—it's how the system is designed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still not clear what that means? Imagine this: a massive company that millions use every day can read
                your emails, access your personal habits, and use that information to tailor ads that hit you when
                you're most vulnerable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's say you just slammed the brakes hard in your car. Moments later, you see an insurance ad pop up
                on your phone. Coincidence? Not likely. They know you're shaken—and that's a perfect time to sell.
                Your real-life stress becomes a profit opportunity.

            <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-600">
              <p>
                We are encouraged to use credit cards for convenience. But over time, that ease turns into habit—and
                soon, a cycle of overspending and debt begins. Even when we pay our bills, the loop continues. There's no
                doubt technology has improved our lives, but society hasn't done enough to teach people how to use these
                tools responsibly.
