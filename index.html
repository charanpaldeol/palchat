                <h3>Privacy on the Internet Must Be a Right of Every Human</h3>
                <p>
                    Big corporations store and analyze our data, then target us with ads or content that benefits their profits instead of our well-being.
                    This imbalance in power and transparency needs to be addressed by policy, awareness, and product design.

        <h3>Credit Card and Debt Cycle</h3>
        <p>
            We are encouraged to use credit cards for convenience. But over time, that ease turns into habitâ€”and soon, a cycle of overspending and debt begins. Even when we pay our bills, the loop continues.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's no doubt technology has improved our lives, but society hasn't done enough to teach people how to use these tools responsibly. Some learn the hard way and grow wiser; others fall too deep and lose hope, stuck in debt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, for corporations, profit is often the only goal.
