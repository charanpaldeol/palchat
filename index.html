<h2> My Big Ideas </h2>

<ul>
<li>  <h3>Privacy on internet must be a right of every human. </h3> </li>
<p>The Big corportaion store all our data, analyize our data and the target us with Ads or content that helps them make money rather then for users well being. </p>

</ul>

<h3> Credit Card or dept Cycle. </h3>
<p> We are encourgaed to spend money by using CC. Once we are used to the covenince, what happnes? </br>
The answer is we start speding more than we should be, even if we are able to pay the bills still the endless cycle of debt and repay keep happening.</br>
No doubt these techonologies have make huge positive impacts on world, but as socitey we took very little responibilte to teach people how to responsbily use these techonolgies rather we let them pay. Some learns from mistkes and get wisers, others go so deep that</br>
they just loose the hope and start syaing deep in the dept cycle. Corportaions make money, that is all what theier primary goal is.
