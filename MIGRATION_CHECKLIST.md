## üöÄ Migration Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Add Python Backend (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Add Python backend alongside existing Astro frontend

#### Setup Tasks
- [ ] Create Python backend directory structure
- [ ] Set up FastAPI application

- [ ] Configure CORS for frontend integration

#### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Create proxy configuration for API calls
- [ ] Test API communication between frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement basic authentication system
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create deployment configuration

#### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Test Python backend independently
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test deployment pipeline

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Migrate API endpoints one by one

#### Migration Order
1. **Contact Form API** (Priority: High)
   - [ ] Create Python contact endpoint
   - [ ] Test email functionality
   - [ ] Update frontend to use Python API
   - [ ] Remove Astro contact API
   - [ ] Verify no functionality loss

2. **AI Agent API** (Priority: High)
   - [ ] Implement AI agent in Python
   - [ ] Create chat endpoint
   - [ ] Add conversation storage
   - [ ] Test AI functionality
   - [ ] Update frontend integration

3. **User Management** (Priority: Medium)
   - [ ] Create user registration/login
   - [ ] Implement privacy settings
   - [ ] Add user preferences
   - [ ] Test user flows

4. **Analytics API** (Priority: Low)
   - [ ] Create privacy-respecting analytics
   - [ ] Implement data retention policies
   - [ ] Add user consent management

#### Testing After Each Migration
- [ ] Test migrated functionality
- [ ] Verify no regression in other features
- [ ] Check performance impact
- [ ] Validate security measures
- [ ] Test deployment

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Complete Python backend, remove Astro API endpoints

#### Final Tasks
- [ ] Migrate all remaining API endpoints
- [ ] Remove Astro API directory
- [ ] Update all frontend API calls
- [ ] Optimize Python backend performance
- [ ] Implement advanced security measures
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

#### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Full system integration test
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Load testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Triggers

### Critical Issues (Immediate Rollback)
- [ ] Any security vulnerability
- [ ] Complete system failure
- [ ] Data loss or corruption
- [ ] User data privacy breach
- [ ] Mission alignment violation

### Performance Issues (Investigate First)
- [ ] Significant performance degradation (>50% slower)
- [ ] High error rates (>5%)
- [ ] Memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- [ ] Database connection issues

### User Experience Issues (Gradual Rollback)
- [ ] Broken functionality
- [ ] Poor user experience
- [ ] Navigation issues
- [ ] Design inconsistencies

## üîÑ Rollback Process

### Quick Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# 1. Stop Python backend deployment
# 2. Run rollback script
./rollback-to-stable.sh

# 3. Verify rollback
node verify-stable-state.js

# 4. Deploy to Vercel
git push origin v1.0.0-stable-astro
```

### Gradual Rollback (Non-Emergency)
1. **Identify the issue**
2. **Document the problem**
3. **Create a fix branch**
4. **Test the fix thoroughly**
5. **Deploy the fix**
6. **Monitor for resolution**
